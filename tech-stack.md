# Tech Stack

## Frontend
- React with TypeScript – widely adopted, strong ecosystem for building dashboards and data-heavy UIs
- Tailwind CSS – fast styling without fighting a component library
- React Router – client-side routing

## Backend
- Node.js with Express and TypeScript – keeps the entire stack in one language, simple to set up REST APIs
- Database-backed sessions for authentication (e.g., using `express-session` with a session store)

## Database
- MySQL – relational data (tickets, users, categories) fits naturally into tables with foreign keys. Good for filtering/sorting queries

## ORM
- Prisma – type-safe database access, easy migrations, works great with TypeScript (supports MySQL)

## AI
- Claude API (Anthropic) – for ticket classification, summaries, and suggested replies. Strong at following instructions and working with structured output

## Email
- SendGrid or Mailgun – for sending outbound replies. Inbound can be handled via webhooks

## Deployment
- Docker + a cloud provider (AWS, Railway, Fly.io, etc.)
